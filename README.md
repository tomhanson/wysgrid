# wysgrid

A lightweight grid system that still maintains the bootstrap style grid breakpoints.

Works for mobile or desktop first. Just choose the relevent folder for you.

no need to declare xs-12 on mobiles as this will happen automatically under your desired smallest break point.
for desktop first version it is the opposite so no need to define col-xl-12 as this is automatic above your largest desired break point.
